      <h2> I will be documenting my project progress here </h2>
      
      <h1> Project Plan </h1>
      <p>
        LEVEL 1:
Chrome extension that 
Has sign in/sign out and account features
Has user database
Interactive interface 
Able to trigger when user is on a check out page
Chrome extension application is able to recognize when user has navigated to checkout pages of website(honey & capital one shopping do this)
Chrome extension application is able to recognize and pop up when a user is on a shopping site (honey & capital one shopping do this)
Logs when a person has made a purchase
Application is able to register on a separate database when a person has made a purchase
Where to house this separate database?
How to have this register?
Connects to a returns database
The database will be basic where I will manually fill in return dates/policies of companies
Find a place to house the database that is compatible with chrome extension
Have the chrome extension backend be connected to database
      </p>

LEVEL 2:
All features in level 1
Sends automated email to user when prompted
Has capability of sending an email to user when 
Scrapes web to generate extensive returns database
Make a web scraper to compile a database of return policy and dates
      </p>

LEVEL 3: 
All features in level 2
iphone application to keep track of one’s returns

      <h1>Week 2: Research </h1>
      What I did this week:
Researched other similar chrome extensions to learn how their features work and how that can be applied/tweaked for my project
Honey & Capital one shopping
Chrome extensions that are also related to online shopping. 
Have features that I would like to imitate like:
Recognizes when user is on an online shopping site
Pops up when a user is on the check out page of a site
Has login/user capabilities
Stores some type of database on discount information and connects that with user input/info from shopping sites. 
Takeaways



Challenges:
Unsure how most of the features I want to imitate from Honey & Capital one are implemented as they do not publicly document this. Features such as:
recognizes when user is on a check out page
Database connected with chrome extension

Goals for next week:
Learn how to make basic chrome extension
Set up basic chrome extension
      
      <h1>Week 3: Chrome Extension Set up </h1>
      What I did this week:
Learned the basics of building web extension (manifest.json, loading unpacked extension, console logs/errors, error logs, etc) 
Followed some tutorials on how to build out chrome extension:
Google chrome developers - getting started
Google Chrome Extensions - Development Basics
Chrome Developer chrome extension example/tutorial
Chrome Developer chrome extension example 2
Set up basic chrome extension

Challenges:
Chrome extension ugly
Not proficient in front end/javascript

Goals for next week:
Familiarize self with javascript and chrome extension: Get extension to recognize which site it’s on and later on check to see if site user is on is in our database
Make database of sites and return policies
Research how to do this and best way to do this for a chrome extension
Get extension to link to specific store return policy
Match store name and see if it exists in our database

      <h1> Week 4:  Smarter Chrome Extension & Pivoting</h1>
      Recognizing site & recognizing “order placed” page:
Get extension to get url of the site it is on
Stumbled upon Returnqueen:
Sign into email and get all of your orders from email (guessing through order confirmation)?
Also shows accurate/semi-accurate date to return according to specific store return policies
Also has an amazon integration feature
How hard is it to get access to gmail data? – get confirmation. How hard is this compared to getting to after checkout page 


Database with chrome extension:
Research on database used with chrome extension:
Locally or on server?
Specifically → how to store persistent data with chrome extension
Chrome.storage API?
Currently attempting to use JSON to store data → more compatible for storing temporary data?

Make database of sites and return policies and connect to extension
First step – get extension to display return policy for specific store 
Get extension to link to specific store return policy
Match store name and see if it exists in our database
How to get json data in javascript: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_parse.asp#:~:text=Use%20the%20JavaScript%20function%20JSON,will%20get%20a%20syntax%20error.

Challenges:
Unsure how to make a database to connect to chrome extension to store information 
Currently using: json?
Might want to get shopping order info via gmail rather than order placed page to get more info and be more accurate

Next steps:
Continue database implementation from this week
Research more into linking gmail 

      
      <h1>Week 5: Gmail, OAuth, and Google Chrome API</h1>
      Research on getting access to gmail information → this can be done via the gmail API:

      <h1>Week 6: Continuing last weeks work</h1>
Started implementing Gmail API to chrome extension
Added necessary code to manifest.json, index.html, javascript files, etc. 
Uploaded extension to developer dashboard
Created OAuth Client ID
Registered OAuth in manifest
Initiate first OAuth Flow
Challenges: Stuck on initiating first OAuth Flow → bug somewhere. Keep getting error message
