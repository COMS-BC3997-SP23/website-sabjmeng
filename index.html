 <h1> 1/23 - 1/29 Week 1: Planning </h1>
 Research and explored potential project ideas. Developed outline of project. 
      
<h1>1/30 - 2/5 Week 2: Research </h1>
What I did this week:
Researched other similar chrome extensions to learn how their features work and how that can be applied/tweaked for my project<br>
Honey & Capital one shopping (Chrome extensions that are also related to online shopping)<br> 
Have features that I would like to imitate like: <br>
Recognizes when user is on an online shopping site<br>
Pops up when a user is on the check out page of a site<br>
Has login/user capabilities<br>
Stores some type of database on discount information and connects that with user input/info from shopping sites.<br>

Challenges:<br>
Unsure how most of the features I want to imitate from Honey & Capital One Shopping are implemented as they do not publicly document this. Features such as:
recognizes when user is on a check out page. <br>

Goals for next week:<br>
  <ul>
  <li>Learn how to make basic chrome extension</li>
  <li>Set up basic chrome extension</li>
</ul>
      
<h1>2/6 - 2/12 Week 3: Chrome Extension Set up </h1>
What I did this week:<br>
<ul>
<li> Learned the basics of building web extension (manifest.json, loading unpacked extension, console logs/errors, error logs, etc) </li>
<li> Read Google Developer Guides on getting started with chrome extensions: <br> 
  https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/<br>
  https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/ <br>
  https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/extensions-101/ <br>
  https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/ <br>
  </li>
 <li> Followed tutorials from Google Developer Guide on how to build out chrome extension: <br>
   Reading Time Extension Example : https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/tut-reading-time/ <br>
   Tabs Manager Extension Example: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/tut-tabs-manager/<br>
  </li>
<li>Watched Youtube Tutorials on how to build Chrome Extension:<br>

 </ul>
      
 <h1> 2/12 - 2/19 Week 4:  Set Up Basic Chrome Extension </h1>
 Coded basic chrome extension in Visual Studio Code using the research I had done in the previous week. Got a basic Chrome Exension up and running that can be
be accessed through my Chrome Browser. Load Unpacked onto my Chrome. Able to be clicked on and viewed. <br>
      
  Challenges: 
      <ul>
        <li> Extension has no styling so it is not very visually appealing </li>
      </ul> <br>
  Goals for Next Week: <br>
      
      <ul>
        <li> Familiarize self with javascript and chrome extension: Get extension to recognize which site it’s on and later on check to see if site user is on is in our database
        </li>
        <li>
          Make database of sites and return policies: Research how to do this and best way to do this for a chrome extension
        </li>
      </ul>
      

      <h1> 2/12 - 2/19 Week 5: Recognizing Online Store User is Visiting & Database Research</h1> 
      Research how to get Chrome Extension to know what shop user is viewing. Figured out best way to do this is to first get the URL the user is currently viewing and then parse through that URL to figure out exact store. <br>
      Utilized Stack Overflow to figure out how to get URL from Chrome Extension. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1979583/how-can-i-get-the-url-of-the-current-tab-from-a-google-chrome-extension <br>
      Used Javascript string manipulation to parse through URL to be left with only the store name.<br>
      
      Database Research <br>
      Started researching potential ways to store store return policies and user information. A few potential options are through JSON data, CSV file, or the simplest way would be a Javascript Dictionary. <br>
      
      Challenges:
      <ul>
        <li>What to do if store URL and store name are different?</li>
        <li>Unsure which database option is most suitable for this project</li>
        <li>Never implemented/connected database to frontend before and am unsure how this would work out and potentially how long this woudl take</li>
      </ul>
      
      Next Week: Populate database with store and return policies. Figure out how to recognize when user is on a checkout page. <br>
      
      
    <h1> 2/27 - 3/5 Week 6: Getting rid of user info & checkout page recognition & Populating Database</h1>

Get extension to get url of the site it is on
Stumbled upon Returnqueen:
Sign into email and get all of your orders from email (guessing through order confirmation)?
Also shows accurate/semi-accurate date to return according to specific store return policies
Also has an amazon integration feature
How hard is it to get access to gmail data? – get confirmation. How hard is this compared to getting to after checkout page 


Database with chrome extension:
Research on database used with chrome extension:
Locally or on server?
Specifically → how to store persistent data with chrome extension
Chrome.storage API?
Currently attempting to use JSON to store data → more compatible for storing temporary data?

Make database of sites and return policies and connect to extension
First step – get extension to display return policy for specific store

Match store name and see if it exists in our database

Challenges:
Unsure how to make a database to connect to chrome extension to store information 
Currently using: json?
Might want to get shopping order info via gmail rather than order placed page to get more info and be more accurate

Next steps:
Continue database implementation from this week
Research more into linking gmail
