 <h1> 1/23 - 1/29 Week 1: Planning </h1>
 Research and explored potential project ideas. Developed outline of project. 
      
<h1>1/30 - 2/5 Week 2: Research </h1>
<img src="Screen Shot 2023-05-10 at 11.03.35 PM.png" width="1000"> <br>
What I did this week:
Researched other similar chrome extensions to learn how their features work and how that can be applied/tweaked for my project<br>
Honey & Capital one shopping (Chrome extensions that are also related to online shopping)<br> 
Have features that I would like to imitate like: <br>
Recognizes when user is on an online shopping site<br>
Pops up when a user is on the check out page of a site<br>
Has login/user capabilities<br>
Stores some type of database on discount information and connects that with user input/info from shopping sites.<br>

Challenges:<br>
Unsure how most of the features I want to imitate from Honey & Capital One Shopping are implemented as they do not publicly document this. Features such as:
recognizes when user is on a check out page. <br>

Goals for next week:<br>
  <ul>
  <li>Learn how to make basic chrome extension</li>
  <li>Set up basic chrome extension</li>
</ul>
      
<h1>2/6 - 2/12 Week 3: Chrome Extension Set up </h1>
      <img src = "Screen Shot 2023-05-10 at 11.03.42 PM.png" width = "1000"> <br>

 <h1> 2/12 - 2/19 Week 4:  Set Up Basic Chrome Extension </h1>
      <img src = "Screen Shot 2023-05-10 at 11.03.50 PM.png" width = "1000"> <br>
 Coded basic chrome extension in Visual Studio Code using the research I had done in the previous week. Got a basic Chrome Exension up and running that can be
be accessed through my Chrome Browser. Load Unpacked onto my Chrome. Able to be clicked on and viewed. <br>
      
  Challenges: 
      <ul>
        <li> Extension has no styling so it is not very visually appealing </li>
      </ul> <br>
  Goals for Next Week: <br>
      
      <ul>
        <li> Familiarize self with javascript and chrome extension: Get extension to recognize which site it’s on and later on check to see if site user is on is in our database
        </li>
        <li>
          Make database of sites and return policies: Research how to do this and best way to do this for a chrome extension
        </li>
      </ul>
      

      <h1> 2/12 - 2/19 Week 5: Recognizing Online Store User is Visiting & Database Research</h1> 
      Research how to get Chrome Extension to know what shop user is viewing. Figured out best way to do this is to first get the URL the user is currently viewing and then parse through that URL to figure out exact store. <br>
      Utilized Stack Overflow to figure out how to get URL from Chrome Extension. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1979583/how-can-i-get-the-url-of-the-current-tab-from-a-google-chrome-extension <br>
      Used Javascript string manipulation to parse through URL to be left with only the store name.<br>
      
      Database Research <br>
      Started researching potential ways to store store return policies and user information.
Research on database used with chrome extension: 
      <ul>
        <li>Locally or on server?</li>
         <li>Specifically → how to store persistent data with chrome extension</li>
        <li>Chrome.storage API?</li>
      </ul>

Currently attempting to use JSON to store data → more compatible for storing temporary data?
      
      Current Plan:
<ul>
  <li> Make database of sites and return policies and connect to extension</li>
  <li> First step – get extension to display return policy for specific store </li>
  <li>Get extension to link to specific store return policy </li>
  <li> Match store name and see if it exists in our database</li>

</ul>
<br>
      Research on JSON database & How to get json data in javascript: <br>
      <ul>
        <li>https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_parse.asp#:~:text=Use%20the%20JavaScript%20function%20JSON,will%20get%20a%20syntax%20error.
</li>
        <li>https://sebhastian.com/display-javascript-variable-html/ </li>
        <li>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12070631/how-to-use-json-file-in-html-code </li>
        <li>https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/xhr/ </li>
      </ul>


      Challenges:
      <ul>
        <li>What to do if store URL and store name are different?</li>
        <li>Unsure which database option is most suitable for this project</li>
        <li>Never implemented/connected database to frontend before and am unsure how this would work out and potentially how long this woudl take</li>
        <li> json storage seems promising but having some trouble with implementation </li>
      </ul>
      
      Next Week: Populate database with store and return policies. Figure out how to recognize when user is on a checkout page. <br>
      
      
    <h1> 2/27 - 3/5 Week 6: Prioritization Reorganization and Populating Database </h1> <br>
      Decided to not prioritize user log-in features and checkout page information as they are not essential in pulling together a MVP solution for the problem I'm tackling. These would be great to look into in the future<br>
      Prioritizing implementing the database and then connecting that with the front end is a priority is that is an essential part of the extension. The database should store the store name and it's corresponding return policy. At the most basic leve, the extension should show the store's return policy and after that is implemented I will try to calculate and show the return deadline to users. <br>
      Implementing Database: <br>
      <ul>
        <li> (Done) Decided on using a Javascript Dictionary for simplicity instead of JSON</li>
        <li> (Done) The key of the dictionary contains the store name and the value contains the return policy  </li>
        <li> Chrome extension should display store return policy based on which store user is on  </li>
      </ul>
      
      
      Challenges:
      <ul>
        <li>How to display different return policy based on store user is on</li>

      </ul>
      
        Next Week:
      <ul> 
        <li>Research how to get extension to show return policy specific to store.  </li>
      </ul>
 


   <h1> 2/27 - 3/5 Week 7: Pivoting:  Gmail, OAuth, and Google Chrome API </h1> <br>
      <img src = "Screen Shot 2023-05-10 at 11.03.55 PM.png" width = "1000>  <br>
      While researching this week, I stumbled upon an app I hadn't seen before: Returnqueen <br>
      This app is for helping customers bring their returns back to the store from their house, but has a feature that seems to connect to users' emails and get their shopping information from there. This could be really good route to take to get more accurate order and shipping information from users. 
      Questions: 
      <ul>
        <li> How does Returnqueen sign into email and get all of your orders from email (guessing through order confirmation)?</li>
        <li> How does it show accurate/semi-accurate date to return according to specific store return policies? </li>
        <li> How hard is it to get access to gmail data? – get confirmation. How hard is this compared to getting to after checkout page 
</li>
      </ul>
      
      Research on getting access to gmail information → this can be done via the gmail API:
