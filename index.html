      <h1>Week 2: Research </h1>
      What I did this week:
Researched other similar chrome extensions to learn how their features work and how that can be applied/tweaked for my project
Honey & Capital one shopping
Chrome extensions that are also related to online shopping. 
Have features that I would like to imitate like:
Recognizes when user is on an online shopping site
Pops up when a user is on the check out page of a site
Has login/user capabilities
Stores some type of database on discount information and connects that with user input/info from shopping sites. 
Takeaways



Challenges:
Unsure how most of the features I want to imitate from Honey & Capital one are implemented as they do not publicly document this. Features such as:
recognizes when user is on a check out page
Database connected with chrome extension
